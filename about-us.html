                        <p>
                            The struggle to give women their rights, to make them independent and stand out as a strong character has been over
                            decades. Today the world has somehow managed enough to attain it to a certain extent and the credit for it goes to all
                            those men who have been supportive, who have fought for it, to all the women who stood out brighter enough to lighten
                            the paths for the rest. Be it in the field of sports, education, business or fashion or any form of art, women are on the verge of shaping the world into a completely different structure with their storming records. They are on their way to break all hurdles and show the world that they were never inferior.<br><br>
                            One of such inspiring women is <b>Ms. Padmini Panigrahi</b>, the lady with a golden heart. Striking harder with each ball she
                            comes across, Padmini is all set to bring out a huge change in the society by her deeds.<br><br>
                            Belonging from The Steel City of Odisha (Rourkela), Padmini has always been an artist. Starting her career as a
                            professional entertainer, she soon was all set to takeover business and become a role model to the society. Today, she
                            is running a well-established business firm apart from having an expertise in singing and dancing.<br><br>
                            <b>“Different is the new trend”</b> is what she has projected with her deeds. Changing tracks has never been an easy task but
                            Padmini has made it possible. “Beauty with Brains” is all that can be tagged on to this amazing lady.

                            <p>
                                Padmini began her career as a leading director where she worked with Sanjog mobile from 2000 to 2006. And then within a
                                month she got into another car dealing firm at Rourkela. She is still working with the Koshala Hyundai. <br><br>
                                Having an expertise in classical dancing Padmini has completed her MA in Performing Arts from Sambalpur University. She
                                also garners an MSc from the same. In addition to this she also has done her Masters in HR and Marketing from XIMB.<br><br>
                                Being real good at multitasking, this lady has been successful enough in maintaining her personal and professional life
                                remarkably well. Having a strong support throughout from her parents to pursue her dreams independently Padmini finds
                                herself lucky enough to find the same characteristics in her husband Mr Prakash Panigrahi. She proudly owes all her
                                achievements to them.<br><br>
                                At a very tender age of 6 Padmini started her dancing lessons and has received ample of laurels throughout her life. Her
                                talents have not just been restricted to Odisha but both at national and international levels. Apart from mesmerizing
                                people of India, she has not failed to dazzle people from Indonesia and South Korea with her dancing moves. She was
                                fortunate enough to learn classical dance from profound Odissi dancers such as Prabhakar Ku. Swain, Sujata Mahapatra,
                                Sunita Pattnaik and Padmashree award winning dancer and mentor Aruna Mohanty. As of now she has an experience of 20
                                years in classical dancing.<br><br>
                                Music flows not just in her dance moves but also in her vocal cords. She has been trained from Gandharva University in
                                Indian Classical Music. Gautam Mukherjee along with Suresh Wadkar have also been mentors to Padmini. She had the
                                opportunity to project her singing talent in many odia songs and folk albums. She has also worked at All India Radio as
                                an accredited singer.<br><br>
                                Being a philanthropist, this multitalented woman has a huge inclination towards working with non-profiting organisations
                                to promote women empowerment in the society. She strongly believes the concept of equality which makes her a feminist in
                                every term.<br><br>
                                She has her own running organisation named <b>“Dream Team”</b> that serves food and minimum required help to the needy and
                                poor.<br><br>
                                Padmini Panigrahi is a distinguished individual as she also advocates to provide equal rights to the transgenders.
                                Panigrahi firmly believes that the third gender or the transgender population must be inflicted with the respect that
                                they need; they should also be given a better standard of living. According to Panigrahi, the young and the budding
                                masses of the society are the future, as they are given the opportunities that never existed earlier. The woman who
                                wants to serve the society also has her own NGO, namely <b>“Koshal Darpana”</b>.<br><br>
                                Koshal Darpana is completely dedicated to the upliftment of the young talented people in Odisha. The NGO provides an
                                opportunity for children who want to participate in the sports industry or the cultural sector. Koshal Darapana is also
                                responsible for garnering talent hunt programs by gaining sponsorship from a different professional aspect. Padmini
                                Panigrahi believes that everything good in this world begins from the change of a heart.<br><br>
                                Padmini is the true modern-day icon and an ideal person that people should look up to for inspiration. Her expertise
                                ranges from politics, social activist to the entertainment industry. Panigrahi is incredibly famous in her hometown,
                                Odisha. Moreover, in her extensive career, Padmini Panigrahi is recognized as the distinctive member of Odia culture.
                                She is yet to live a long life; however, her contributions to the culture and society of Odisha is unprecedented.<br><br>
                                To maintain a healthy life Padmini also has gained an expertise in Yoga. She believes that yoga has a significant amount
                                of similarity with dance and music. She has a degree in Yoga from Munger's Bihar School of Yoga and provides extensive
                                fitness regime program in various local TV channels.<br><br>
                                Apart from everything Padmini is an animal lover and an individual filled with humbleness and of course a role model to
                                every girl out there.
